# Compose Animations

Group of libraries to help you build better animations with [Jetpack Compose][compose]

## About

### Goal

The main goal of this project is to help you build animations with Jetpack Compose. The compose
animations API provides a rich animation API to handle state changes, but you need to implement
some boilerplate code when it comes to other types of animation.

### What's Included?

1. [Easings](./easing/) - A library with 30 different easings to use on your animations
2. [Value Animator Compat](./value-animator-compat/) - Compatibility API with non-compose animations
using ValueAnimator
3. [Value Animator](./value-animator/) - API that provides you the same functionality from
non-compose ValueAnimator, but using only compose methods

## About Touchlab

Touchlab is a mobile-focused development agency based in NYC. We have been working on Android since
the beginning, and have worked on a wide range of mobile and hardware projects for the past decade.
Over the past few years, we have invested significantly on R&D for code sharing technologies.
We believe strongly in KMP's future and are making the Kotlin platform the focus of our business.

### What We Can Do For You

We have made KMP the focus of Touchlab. We had possibly the first KMP* app published in the iOS
App Store, and have extensive experience in building libraries and the Kotlin platform, including
contributions to Kotlin/Native itself. We can establish and accelerate your adoption of shared
Kotlin code. See [touchlab.co](https://touchlab.co) for more info.

Touchlab is looking for a Mobile Developer, with Android/Kotlin experience, who is eager to dive
into Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) development. Come join the remote-first team putting KMM
in production. [More info here](https://go.touchlab.co/careers-gh).
